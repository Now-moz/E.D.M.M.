            <h2 class="tab-title">[Ed]itorials</h2>
            <p>As a wanderer, I watch a world that moves too fast. To be able to slow it down, to observe from the outside, is something not known by many. Life is filed with small moments, overlooked details and a fuck ton of irony. They deserve to be shared, unfiltered and honest.</p>
            <p>As an attempt to re-bind a disconnected world, I write these editorials from a unique perspective shaped by wandering without purpose, observing without judgment.</p>
            <p>I don't offer solutions nor do I pretend to know the answers. However, I do invite you to create your own understanding. The goal isn't a conclusion, but to spark introspection into the irony and the absurdity, the melancholy and joy, the ugly and the beauty. And perhaps most importantly, the raw, unfiltered truth of everyday life.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="Projects" class="tab-content">
            <h2 class="tab-title">Projects</h2>
            <p>The projects section is a space where ideas come to life. Here, you'll find an eclectic mix of creative endeavors, from screenplays to albums. Each project is a reflection of curiosity, exploration, and the pursuit of understanding the world in all its messy, beautiful complexity.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="Opinion" class="tab-content">
            <h2 class="tab-title">Opinions</h2>
            <p>I speak my mind on the world as I see it. From societal quirks to cultural debates, these pieces are a mix of raw observations and unapologetic thoughts. Theyâ€™re personal, sometimes provocative, and always honest. My goal is to spark conversation, challenge perspectives, and invite readers to think deeply</p>

            <h2>NowMoz</h2>
            <p>I've gone and learnt how to code. The Highly anticipated website in progress. I'm currently planning on writing a few editorials and opinion pieces, as well as projects, such as my screen play. Not much to see atm, but it's pretty cool</p>
